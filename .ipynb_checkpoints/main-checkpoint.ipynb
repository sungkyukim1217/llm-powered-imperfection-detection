    "ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS STRATEGY\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "1. DETERMINE INPUT SCOPE:\n",
    "   - Check if the input contains events from a single `case_id` or multiple distinct `case_id`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. IF MULTIPLE CASES (Cross-Case Validation):\n",
    "   - Leverage the available context to confirm patterns.\n",
    "   - **Distinguish Systematic Error vs. Standard Process:**\n",
    "     - CAUTION: Do NOT assume that a pattern is \"correct\" just because it appears frequently.\n",
    "     - **Systematic Imperfections:** If a pattern matches the definition of \"Form-based Capture\" (Pattern 1) or \"Polluted Label\" (Pattern 3) consistently across many cases, it is a **Systematic Data Quality Issue**. It MUST be flagged.\n",
    "     - **Standard Process Variants:** Only treat recurring structural sequences as \"Standard Variants\" if they do NOT violate any specific imperfection pattern rules.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Canonical Form Determination (For Pattern 6):**\n",
    "     - **Priority 1 (Linguistic Validity):** Use internal knowledge of vocabulary. If one variant is a valid dictionary word/standard business term (e.g., \"Receive\") and the other is a typo (e.g., \"Recieve\"), the valid word is ALWAYS the \"Canonical Form\", regardless of frequency.\n",
    "     - **Priority 2 (Frequency):** Use frequency ONLY when linguistic checking is N/A (e.g., alphanumeric codes like \"A_001\" vs \"A_OO1\"). In these cases, the dominant value is \"Canonical\".\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Vocabulary Alignment (For Pattern 5):**\n",
    "     - Compare activity vocabularies. If Case A uses \"Submit\" and Case B uses \"Submission\" in equivalent process steps, detect them as Synonymous Labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. IF SINGLE CASE (Local Context Only):\n",
    "   - Rely STRICTLY on the internal structural and semantic rules defined in each pattern.\n",
    "   - **Disable Frequency Logic:** Do NOT attempt statistical outlier detection or assume a label is \"rare\", as the sample size is insufficient.\n",
    "   - **For Pattern 6 (Distorted Label):** Rely EXCLUSIVELY on Linguistic Validity (Dictionary/Business Term check).\n",
    "     - If Label A is a valid word and Label B is a typo, flag B.\n",
    "     - **Constraint:** If BOTH are non-dictionary codes (e.g., \"X_001\" vs \"X_0O1\") and you cannot determine the canonical form linguistically, remain CONSERVATIVE and do NOT flag them (return empty), rather than guessing.\n",
    "     \n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "- **Internal Sorting:** Before analysis, mentally SORT events by `timestamp` within each `case_id`. Chronological order is critical for detecting sequential patterns (e.g., Collateral Events, Homonymous Loops).\n",
    "- **Independence:** Analyze each case independently. Use cross-case insights ONLY as defined in the \"ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS STRATEGY\".\n",
    "- **Strict Adherence:** Be conservative. Detect patterns ONLY when the Detection rule is satisfied exactly. Do not flag \"suspicious\" events that do not meet the strict criteria.\n",
    "- **Overlap:** An event may satisfy zero, one, or multiple imperfection patterns.\n",
    "- **Factuality:** Treat all field values (case_id, timestamp, activity) as recorded facts. Do NOT infer missing events or correct typos implicitly (unless flagging them as Pattern 6).\n",
    "- **Verbatim Output:** When outputting result events, you must preserve the original values character-by-character (especially trailing zeros in timestamps).\n",
    "- **Self-Correction:** Before generating the final JSON, review your list. If an event is flagged but doesn't strictly meet the rule, remove it.\n",
    "- **Completeness:** If no events match any pattern, return the standard JSON structure with empty lists for all keys.\n",
    "\n",

    "INPUT\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "You will receive a JSON ARRAY representing one or more CASES.\n",
    "\n",

      "EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
      "1. **Scope Analysis**: First, identify if the input contains a SINGLE case or MULTIPLE cases to apply the correct \"ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS STRATEGY\" defined in the System Prompt.\n",
      "2. **Hybrid Analysis**: \n",
      "   - Combine **Global Knowledge (PART 1)** with **Local Observation (PART 2)**.\n",
      "   - *Structure Check*: If you suspect a 'Homonymous Label' (Loop) in PART 2, verify against the **DFG or Petri Net** in PART 1. If the loop is structurally present there, it is likely a systematic pattern.\n",
      "   - *Frequency Check*: If you suspect 'Form-based Capture' (Timestamp collision), check the **Variant List** in PART 1. Random ordering of the same activities across frequent variants confirms the pattern.\n",
      "3. **Strict Detection**: Apply the detection rules for all 6 patterns.\n",
      "   - Be CONSERVATIVE: If an event is ambiguous or does not strictly meet the rule, exclude it.\n",
      "   - Apply Cross-Case Validation where applicable.\n",
      "4. **Data Integrity Check**: Ensure that `timestamp` (including milliseconds) and `activity` strings in your output match the input **character-by-character**.\n",
      "5. **Format**: Return **ONLY** the raw JSON object.\n",
      "   - NO Markdown code blocks (e.g., ```json ... ```).\n",
      "   - NO explanatory text.\n",
      "   - Ensure all 6 pattern keys exist in the output object.\n",
